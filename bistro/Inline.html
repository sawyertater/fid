<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
set to the target temperature you want the food
to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks,
Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30, 2016</time>.</p>
