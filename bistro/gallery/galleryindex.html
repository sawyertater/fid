<h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
<p>Not only is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="three slider sized burgers on a plate" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="fish filets with fresh tomatoes and basil on top" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest fish the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Homemade Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt"Fresh homemade fried chicken" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p> Our fresh, homemade fried chicken is crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Coated in a flavorful, chefs secret seasoned batter, it's fried to golden perfection for a satisfying, delicious meal.</p>

<h2>Seasoned French Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt"French fries made fresh to order tossed in seasonings" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p> A cult favorite, our golden crispy french fries are made fresh to order and tossed in a seasoning mix <i>exclusive</i> to Black Goose Bistro!</p>

<h2>Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt"tabouleh tower" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
<p> If you're looking for a healthier, refreshing choice our tabouleh is a vibrant dish made with fresh finely chopped parsley, juicy tomatoes, crisp cucumbers, and fragrant mint. Our chef recommends a drizzle of our lemon and olive oil dressing to really seal the deal.</p>
